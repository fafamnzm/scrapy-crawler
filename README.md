# scrapy-crawler
crawler using scrapy

  pip install scrapy

In this example we used the : https://blog.scrapinghub.com/

to see how it works, after installing the dependencies,
navigate to the folder with scrapy.cfg
which is the first spidy folder

then in the terminal write: 
      scrapy crawl scrapinghub -o data.json

this will give you a json file of the data on the website
with updating the url and the css we can use it for other websites

give me some feedback if you like
thanks
